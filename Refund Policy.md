At cuttingasmr.org, we strive to provide our users with the best experience possible. We understand that circumstances may change, and you might need to request a refund. Please read our refund policy carefully before making a purchase.

**Registration Agreement**: By creating an account and using our service, you automatically agree to this Refund Policy along with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

**Service Quality**: Our Veo3 ASMR technology produces excellent results, but if you're not satisfied, try adjusting your prompt with more specific details about the desired mood, lighting, or audio elements. Since each AI ASMR generation consumes credits, we recommend reviewing our template examples first.
